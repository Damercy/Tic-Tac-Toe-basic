#### Dependencies  
1. nodejs 
2. npm (comes bundled with nodejs)
3. npx (comes bundled with npm 5.2+)  

Run the following commands on your bash terminal (Ubuntu 18.04) and you'll have installed all the dependencies:  

``` shell
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

#### How to start the game
Although I could've simply attached the script to a HTML page so that you can simply play the game on a page in your browser, I didn't and that's probably because you (a viewer) doesn't exist. But if you do, you're all *pros*, I know it.

After finishing the installation of dependencies, do the following steps:

``` shell
git clone 'this repo'
cd Tic-Tac-Toe-basic
npm start
```

In case of any errors, trying the following:
``` shell
cd Tic-Tac-Toe-basic
npx create-react-app xyz
//installs reacts and dependencies
rm -r xyz
npm start
```
